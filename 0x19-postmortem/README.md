# The Great Cookie Crumble: A Web Service Postmortem

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: 2 hours and 37 minutes, from 14:23 to 17:00 UTC on August 15, 2024
- **Impact**: Our cookie-based authentication service went down faster than a house of cards in a tornado. 73% of users were left crumbless, unable to access their accounts or place orders for our delicious virtual cookies.
- **Root Cause**: A half-baked deployment of a new feature caused our cookie jar to overflow, resulting in a system-wide indigestion.

## Timeline
- **14:23 UTC**: Our monitoring system burped, alerting us that something was cooking... and not in a good way.
- **14:25 UTC**: Our on-call engineer, Bob "Cookie Monster" Smith, received the alert while in a heated debate about chocolate chip vs. oatmeal raisin.
- **14:30 UTC**: Initial investigation revealed that user authentication was failing faster than a souffl√© in an earthquake.
- **14:45 UTC**: Assumed the issue was related to the recent database upgrade. Spent 30 minutes trying to roll back the changes, but no dice.
- **15:15 UTC**: Escalated to the senior engineering team, who were in the middle of a fierce cookie decorating contest.
- **15:30 UTC**: Senior team identified the real culprit: a new feature deployment that was eating up more resources than a hungry teenager.
- **16:45 UTC**: Rolled back the half-baked feature deployment, watched anxiously as the system slowly came back to life.
- **17:00 UTC**: Service fully restored. Collective sigh of relief heard across three time zones.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause was a new feature that was supposed to improve our cookie customization options. However, it had a bug that caused it to create infinite loops of cookie requests, consuming more server resources than Augustus Gloop at Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

We resolved the issue by rolling back the deployment and putting the feature on a strict diet of optimizations and rigorous testing before allowing it back into production.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent future cookie catastrophes, we're implementing the following measures:

1. **Improve our deployment process:**
   - Implement a phased rollout strategy for new features
   - Enhance pre-deployment testing, including stress tests
   - Set up a "canary" deployment system to catch issues before they affect all users

2. **Upgrade our monitoring system:**
   - Add more granular alerts for resource usage spikes
   - Implement better logging for easier debugging

3. **Enhance our incident response:**
   - Create a clear escalation policy
   - Conduct regular "fire drills" to practice handling outages

4. **Specific TODOs:**
   - Optimize the cookie customization feature code
   - Add rate limiting to prevent resource overconsumption
   - Increase server capacity to handle traffic spikes
   - Update our incident response playbook
