# üç™ The Great Cookie Crumble: A Web Service Postmortem üç™

## Issue Summary

- **Duration**: 2 hours and 37 minutes (14:23 to 17:00 UTC on August 15, 2024)
- **Impact**: Our cookie-based authentication service crumbled faster than a house of cards in a tornado. 73% of users were left crumbless, unable to access their accounts or place orders for our delicious virtual cookies.
- **Root Cause**: A half-baked deployment of a new feature caused our cookie jar to overflow, leading to a system-wide indigestion.

- **14:23 UTC**: Our monitoring system burped, alerting us that something was cooking... and not in a good way.
- **14:25 UTC**: Our on-call engineer, Bob "Cookie Monster" Smith, received the alert while in a heated debate about chocolate chip vs. oatmeal raisin.
- **14:30 UTC**: Initial investigation revealed that user authentication was failing faster than a souffl√© in an earthquake.
- **14:45 UTC**: Assumed the issue was related to the recent database upgrade. Spent 30 minutes trying to roll back the changes, but no dice.
- **15:15 UTC**: Escalated to the senior engineering team, who were in the middle of a fierce cookie decorating contest.
- **15:30 UTC**: Senior team identified the real culprit: a new feature deployment that was eating up more resources than a hungry teenager.
- **16:45 UTC**: Rolled back the half-baked feature deployment, watched anxiously as the system slowly came back to life.
- **17:00 UTC**: Service fully restored. Collective sigh of relief heard across three time zones.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause was a new feature meant to improve our cookie customization options. Unfortunately, it had a bug that created infinite loops of cookie requests, consuming more server resources than Augustus Gloop at Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

**Resolution**: We rolled back the problematic feature and put it on a strict diet of optimizations and rigorous testing before allowing it back into production.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To avoid future cookie catastrophes, we're implementing the following measures:

1. **Improve Our Deployment Process**:
   - Implement a phased rollout strategy for new features
   - Enhance pre-deployment testing, including stress tests
   - Set up a "canary" deployment system to catch issues before they affect all users

2. **Upgrade Our Monitoring System**:
   - Add more granular alerts for resource usage spikes
   - Implement better logging for easier debugging

3. **Enhance Our Incident Response**:
   - Create a clear escalation policy
   - Conduct regular "fire drills" to practice handling outages

4. **Specific TODOs**:
   - Optimize the cookie customization feature code
   - Add rate limiting to prevent resource overconsumption
   - Increase server capacity to handle traffic spikes
   - Update our incident response playbook
